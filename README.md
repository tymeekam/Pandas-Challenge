# Pandas-Challenge
I am the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I have aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance
